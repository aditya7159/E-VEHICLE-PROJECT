                        traditional combustion engine is quickly becoming outdated. Petrol or diesel vehicles are highly
                        polluting and are being quickly replaced by fully electric vehicles. Fully electric vehicles
                        (EV) have zero tailpipe emissions and are much better for the environment. The electric vehicle
                        revolution is here, and you can be part of it. Will your next vehicle be an electric one?

                    <p class="ev-awareness-para">
                        The running cost of an electric vehicle is much lower than an equivalent petrol or diesel
                        vehicle. Electric vehicles use electricity to charge their batteries instead of using fossil
                        fuels like petrol or diesel. Electric vehicles are more efficient, and that combined with the
                        electricity cost means that charging an electric vehicle is cheaper than filling petrol or
                        diesel for your travel requirements. Using renewable energy sources can make the use of electric
                        vehicles more eco-friendly. The electricity cost can be reduced further if charging is done with
                        the help of renewable energy sources installed at home, such as solar panels.

                    <p class="ev-awareness-para">
                        Electric vehicles have very low maintenance costs because they don’t have as many moving parts
                        as an internal combustion vehicle. The servicing requirements for electric vehicles are lesser
                        than the conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. Therefore, the yearly cost of running an
                        electric vehicle is significantly low.

                    <p class="ev-awareness-para">
                        The availability of fossil fuels is limited, and their use is destroying our planet. Toxic
                        emissions from petrol and diesel vehicles lead to long-term, adverse effects on public health.
                        The emissions impact of electric vehicles is much lower than petrol or diesel vehicles. From an
                        efficiency perspective, electric vehicles can covert around 60% of the electrical energy from
                        the grid to power the wheels, but petrol or diesel cars can only convert 17%-21% of the energy
                        stored in the fuel to the wheels. That is a waste of around 80%. Fully electric vehicles have
                        zero tailpipe emissions, but even when electricity production is taken into account, petrol or
                        diesel vehicles emit almost 3 times more carbon dioxide than the average EV. To reduce the
                        impact of charging electric vehicles, India is ambitious to achieve about 40 percent cumulative
                        electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by the year 2030.
                        Therefore, electric vehicles are the way forward for Indian transport, and we must switch to
                        them now.

                        Electric vehicles don’t have gears and are very convenient to drive. There are no complicated
                        controls, just accelerate, brake, and steer. When you want to charge your vehicle, just plug it
                        in to a home or public charger. Electric vehicles are also quiet, so they reduce noise pollution
                        that traditional vehicles contribute to.

                        workplace. These problems can easily be overcome with an electric vehicle. Simply plug your
                        vehicle in at your home charger for 4-5 hours before you plan to go. If you are able to get a
                        charger where you park at home, it is very convenient to plan your journeys in advance. What if
                        you forget to plug in your machine someday? Then you can easily take the help of fast chargers
                        or even battery swapping services if you are on a two-wheeler on the road.

                        No engine means no noise. The electric motor functions so silently that you need to peek into
                        your instrument panel to check if it is ON. Electric vehicles are so silent that manufacturers
                        have to add false sounds in order to make them safe for pedestrians.
