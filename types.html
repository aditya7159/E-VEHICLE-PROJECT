                            <li>Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV): The vehicle uses both the internal combustion
                                (usually petrol) engine and the battery-powered motor powertrain. The petrol engine
                                is used both to drive and charge when the battery is empty. These vehicles are not
                                as efficient as fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.

                                a battery charged from an external socket (they have a plug). This means the
                                vehicle’s battery can be charged with electricity rather than the engine. PHEVs are
                                more efficient than HEVs but less efficient than BEVs.

                <p class="ev-awareness-para">
                    BEVs are also known as All-Electric Vehicles (AEV). Electric Vehicles using BEV technology run
                    entirely on a battery-powered electric drivetrain. The electricity used to drive the vehicle is
                    stored in a large battery pack which can be charged by plugging into the electricity grid. The
                    charged battery pack then provides power to one or more electric motors to run the electric car.

                    <p class="ev-awareness-para">The power for the electric motor is converted from the DC Battery
                        to AC. As the accelerator is pressed, a signal is sent to the controller. The controller
                        adjusts the speed of the vehicle by changing the frequency of the AC power from the inverter
                        to the motor. The motor then connects and leads to the turning of wheels through a cog. If
                        the brakes are pressed, or the electric car is decelerating, the motor becomes an alternator
                        and produces power, which is sent back to the battery

                        PHEVs start-up in all-electric mode and make use of electricity until their battery pack is
                        depleted. Once the battery gets drained, the engine takes over, and the vehicle operates as
                        a conventional, non-plug-in hybrid. PHEVs can be charged by plugging into an outside
                        electric power source, engine, or regenerative braking. When brakes are applied, the
                        electric motor acts as a generator, using the energy to charge the battery. The engine’s
                        power is supplemented by the electric motor; as a result, smaller engines can be used,
                        increasing the car’s fuel efficiency without compromising performance.
